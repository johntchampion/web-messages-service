# Web Messages - Service

This is a basic backend service to support a messaging web app. It has REST API endpoints for certain functions and offers real-time message support with Socket.IO.

This backend service was made to support the web app that was made alongside it. You can find the codebase for that project [here](https://github.com/appdevjohn/web-messages-pwa). In addition, this project requires a running PostgreSQL database, the setup of which can be found [here](https://github.com/appdevjohn/web-messages-db).
